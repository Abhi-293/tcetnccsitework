        <p class="info-text" style="text-align: justify; text-decoration-color: red; "><b>Mr. Sunil Khatri</b></p>
        <p class="info-text" style="text-align: justify;">
          Mr. Sunil Khatri serves as the Care Taker Officer (CTO) for the Naval Wing of the NCC unit at Thakur College of Engineering and Technology (TCET). He plays a crucial role in managing the day-to-day operations of the Naval NCC unit and acts as a vital link between 1 Maharashtra Naval Unit, Mumbai Group 'B', and the TCET NCC administration.
        </p>
        <p class="info-text" style="text-align: justify;">
          With his background as an engineer and a passion for youth development, Mr. Khatri has mentored and guided numerous cadets, not just in naval training activities but also in academic and technical excellence. He oversees administrative tasks, supports event coordination, and ensures smooth communication with the parent naval unit.
        </p>
        <p class="info-text" style="text-align: justify;">
          His dedication to innovation and mentorship has enabled TCET cadets to participate and showcase their technical models at national-level platforms, including the Idea and Innovation Camp at RDC (Republic Day Camp). Through his continuous support and encouragement, Mr. Khatri helps cadets grow holistically—technically, intellectually, and personally.
        </p>
        <p class="info-text" style="text-align: justify;">
          I’m an educator, researcher, and mentor deeply passionate about the world of IoT, AI and Electronics Engineering. Currently, I serve as the Deputy Head of the B.Tech IoT Engineering Department at Thakur College of Engineering and Technology (TCET), where I get to do what I love most—help students turn ideas into real-world innovations.
        </p>
        <p class="info-text" style="text-align: justify;">
          With over eight years of experience in teaching and research, I’ve had the chance to work on blending emerging technologies with practical applications, whether it’s through developing IoT-based systems or mentoring student teams for hackathons and innovation challenges.
        </p>
        <p class="info-text" style="text-align: justify;">
          Beyond the classroom, I’m actively involved in promoting a culture of entrepreneurship and innovation through the Institution’s Innovation Council. I also collaborate with industry and research bodies to bridge the gap between academic learning and real-world application.
        </p>
        <p class="info-text" style="text-align: justify;">
          At the heart of it all, I believe in creating a learning environment that’s curious, collaborative, and future-ready. If you’re working on something exciting in the IoT or EdTech space—or just want to talk ideas—I’d love to connect.
